This is my implementation of the B+ Tree. It works by giving the commands in the following manner :-

i x :- Insert an element x in the B+ Tree
p :- Prints the B+ Tree
l :- Prints all the Leaf Nodes of the B+ Tree
x :- Destroys the Tree and makes it an empty Tree
s x :- Searches the value x in the Tree
q :- Quits the program

The code uses External Merge Sort for sorting the data and generates the sorted data into a final file named output.txt. 
Upon inserting any value the values is writed in the file input.txt and it creates temporary files within the code and 
deletes them when the file output.txt gets created.
